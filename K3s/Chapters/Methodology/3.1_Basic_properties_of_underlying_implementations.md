## Methodology for Research Question 3.1 : Basic properties of underlying implementations

a) What are the principal point of differences between Traefik, HaProxy and Nginx?

b) Which scenarios fit best for the aforementioned alternatives and what are their operational differences?

--------------------------------------------------

As an approach to this research question, A k3s cluster with one master node is set up where two workers nodes were assigned to it. A detailed view of the approach is indicated beloww:

#### * Using Nginx ingress controller : <a href="">Codebase here</a> 

In this experiment, the cluster is set up without deploying the default loadbalancer in k3s called "servicelb"  using the command:

   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--no-deploy traefik --no-deploy servicelb" sh -s -
