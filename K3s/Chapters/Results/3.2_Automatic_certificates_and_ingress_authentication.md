### a) Methods of generating automatic certificates with different type of ingress controllers.

Certificates are key to a functioning of a secure kubernetes cluster enabling the kubernetes components to perform mutual authentication. The fundamental working principle of a certificate in kubernetes functions in the following manner:

* Kubernetes offers an API to request/generate certificates named as <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1</code>

* Clients create a certificate signing request (CSR) and send it to the API server.

* The user who is requesting the certificate is stored as part of the CSR resource.

* This CSR remains in a pending state unless and until a cluster CA approves it.
 
* Once this CSR request is approved, the certificate is issued.
 
>***NOTE***
>- Attention is to be paid that we do not want any random signed certificate here and that these certificates will be signed by the cluster Certificate Authority making sure that every single component in the cluster trusts this CA which further implies that they are going to trust any certificate generated through this API. Thus the CSR has to be approved for the certificate to be issued.


In this part of the research q√∫estion, we focus to generate the certificates automatically using cert-manager integrating wwith Lets Encrypt in order to ensure a smooth generation and aut-renewal whenever the certificates approach towards their expiry.

 
#### Cert-manager:

The beneficial perspective that cert-manager withstands to auto-generate the certificates in kubernetes undergoes the process mentioned below.
