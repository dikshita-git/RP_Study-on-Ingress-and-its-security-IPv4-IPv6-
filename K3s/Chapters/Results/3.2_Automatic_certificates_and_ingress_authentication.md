### a) Methods of generating automatic certificates with different type of ingress controllers.

Certificates are key to a functioning of a secure kubernetes cluster enabling the kubernetes components to perform mutual authentication. The fundamental working principle of a certificate in kubernetes functions in the following manner:

* Kubernetes offers an API to request/generate certificates named as <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1</code>

* Clients create a certificate signing request (CSR) and send it to the API server.

* The user who is requesting the certificate is stored as part of the CSR resource.

* This CSR remains in a pending state unless and until a cluster CA approves it.
 
* Once this CSR request is approved, the certificate is issued.
 
>***NOTE***
>- Attention is to be paid that we do not want any random signed certificate here and that these certificates will be signed by the cluster Certificate Authority making sure that every single component in the cluster trusts this CA which further implies that they are going to trust any certificate generated through this API. Thus the CSR has to be approved for the certificate to be issued.


In this part of the research q√∫estion, we focus to generate the certificates automatically using cert-manager integrating wwith Lets Encrypt in order to ensure a smooth generation and aut-renewal whenever the certificates approach towards their expiry.

It is a kubernetes-native ccrtificate management controller coonsisting of <a href="">CustomResourceDefinitions *</a>
 

##### CustomResourceDefinitions *:

CRDs in short can be considered as some blocks of data which provides a technique to create, store and expose kubernetes API objects containing data but they taake no action sby themselves. Thus, in order to add some functionality por purpose to their usage, controller sor operaators are appended to them. The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. CRD operations, however, are handled inside kube-apiserver by the apiextensions-apiserver module. This is not a separate process, but a module integrated into kube-apiserver.
 
In terms of kubernetes, they can be defined as extension to kubernetes API which are not necessarily available while the default installation of kubernetes. It aims to define new aand unique object types like pods, replica-sets, configmaps, ingresses and enable us to manage them using the built-in kubernetes command-line-interface "kubectl".

The beneficial perspective that cert-manager withstands to auto-generate the certificates in kubernetes undergoes the process mentioned below.
