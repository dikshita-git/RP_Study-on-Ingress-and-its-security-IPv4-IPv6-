***************************************************************************************************************************



One of the most important necessities of ingress controllers is that it supports both <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Chapters/Results/3.1_Basic_properties_of_underlying_implementations.md#path-based-routing">Path-based</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Chapters/Results/3.1_Basic_properties_of_underlying_implementations.md#host-based-routing">Host-based loadbalancing </a> and SSL termination. In this project, mostly host-based loadbalancing is used. Moreover, the L7 laodbalancing supports only HTTP and HTTPS rules for directing the trafiic and hence they listen on port numbers 80 and 443 respectively.

#### Path-based routing:

* No host is specified here. Thus, the rule is applicable to all the inbound HTTP(S) traffic through the ingress controller.
* <code>PathType</code> field is required and specifies one of the three possible ways of interpretation of ingress object path mainly: ***"Exact"*** , ***"Prefix"***.
  
  <code>Exact</code> - matches the URL path exactly and with case sensitivity.
  
  <code>Prefix</code> - here the matches are based on a URL path prefix split by /. Moreover, the matches are case-sensitive too liek in Exact type and is done on path element-by-element basis. 
  
Refer to the link <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/wiki/Master-Project-Wiki#16-routing-in-ingress"><code>here</code></a> to read more about Path-based routing in ingress in kubernetes.


#### Host-based routing:

* Here instead of having a path, we have a proper domain name.
* Thus if a request comes from a particular DNS name like <a href="https://dkrp2.xyz/">dkrp2.xyz</a>, the traffic gets further forwarded to ***backend services***


ðŸ’¡<b>NOTE:</b> ðŸ”¦
> Ingress has a strong precedence over NodePort or Loadbalancer in a way that it can integrate and amalgamate thee routing rules in a single resource to expose the multiple services available for the particular application.
> Ingress defines the routing rules for traffic which includes protocols like HTTPS/HTTPS, loadbalancing, path-based routing, SSL termination etc.  whereas Ingress controller is the component which holds the responsibility to implement all the ingress rules normally with a loadbalancer with an aim to handle the traffic .



## a) Nginx-based Ingress controller Vs HaProxy-based ingress controller Vs Traefik

Ingress in kubernetes can be implemented by using different ingress controllers like Nginx, Haproxy, Traefik, Istio, Envoy etc. Each ingress should specify a ***class*** which can be defined as a reference to an <code>IngressClass</code> resource which contains additional configurations including the name of the controller that should implement the class. 

ðŸ’¡<b>NOTE:</b> ðŸ”¦

> ðŸ”´Without ingress class, the ingress controller will not evaulate the ingress rules.

Here is an example(see under annotations of the ingress.yaml):<a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Demo/Certificate_with_k3s%2Bnginx/Ingress.yaml"><code>Click here</code></a>

##### * HTTP2

A binary protocol (revision of HTTP versions) which introduces the concept of full requests and response multiplexing. This led to achieving efficiency in terms of:

* Network Speed
* Security
* Reliability
* Compression
* Multiplexing

This is a summary derived from <a href="https://cheapsslsecurity.com/p/http2-vs-http1/">Reference</a>


##### * gRPC

* It is a modern lighweight communication protocol to connect services efficiently in and across the data centers with siupport for loadbaalncing, health-check, authentication and tracing.
* Based on protocol buffer which is basically an open source mechanism in order to serialize the structed data and is language and platform neutral.
* Works effectively with L7 or application layer proxy loadbalancing.

Here are the reference list: <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/tech/software-engineering/grpc-framework-for-microservices-communication/">gRPC framework</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/performance?view=aspnetcore-6.0">gRPC performance</a>


##### * Regex - Regular Expression

The ingress controller supports case insensitive regular expressions in the spec.rules.http.paths.path field. This can be enabled by setting the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex annotation to true (the default is false). Reference: <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/ingress-path-matching/">Read here</a>

The comparison table is inspired by: <a href="https://kubevious.io/blog/post/comparing-top-ingress-controllers-for-kubernetes">Read here</a>

After an investgation for the differences between variations of ingress controllers, my practical demonstrations implemented with:

* <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Demo/Certificate_with_k3s+traefik/README.md"><code>Traefik</code></a>

* <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Demo/Certificate_with_k3s+nginx/README.md"><code>Nginx</code></a>

* <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/tree/main/K3s/Demo/Certificate_with_k3s%2BHaProxy#readme"><code>HaProxy</code></a>


An idea that could be derived after conducting these experiments is that every ingress controller implementation is useful and beneficial but a class of division extracted below could provide a lucid roadmap to using the variations of ingress controllers basede on scenarios:

### 1. Choosing the Traffic Protocol

The first and most important requirement that drives in to choose an ingress controller is concentrated upon which type of routing protocol do we want to route in the project: Is it just a HTTP(S)/HTTP/2 routing? Or we want to route UDP/TCP or GRPC? These classification are crucial to analyse the basic starting point to choose which ingress controller could be taken under consideration. 

Referring to the <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Chapters/Results/3.1_Basic_properties_of_underlying_implementations.md#the-section-below-includes-a-comparison-table-showing-the-focal-point-of-differences-between-the-mostly-used-opensource-ingress-controllers">table above</a>, we can infer that:

* If the requirement is only to route HTTP(S)/HTTP/2 or websockets, then any of the three ingress controller implementations could be used.
* But if the scenario is to route:

  * TCP or TCP+TLS: Traefik or haporxy can be good choices
  * TCP/UDP: Nginx can serve this purpose


### 2. Based on loadbalancing algorithms:

As we have seen above that all of the ingress controllers support round-robin loadbalancing algorithm, thus now the complexity on the basis of connection should be preferred for consideration if our demand lies on using the least connection possible taking service load into count. In this case, we need to opt for a more advanced loadbalancing alogorthim supported ingress controller.


### 3. Availability:

While choosing an ingress controller, the factor that should never be neglected is its higher availability because we would never want to afford a downtime or unplanned maintenance for our application running in the cluster. Some ingress controller need a downtime in order to update or upgrade their configuration while some also update/upgrade dynamically without undergoing a downtime.


### 4. Scalability:

Ingress controller scaling is not a very complex factor to implement but not all ingress controller has teh capability to scale up/down or even autoscale. Nginx and HaProxy in this case can autoscale and thus proves itself to be a good fit to reduce latency of the kubernetes cluster.

As a summarized point of view, it can be stated that before making a choice which variation we want to implement, it ii svery crucial to know the requireent and use-case of the implementation. From a beginner's perspective, Nginx could be considered the initial point of start because it is the easiest to use for a person who holds a basic concept about ingress and wants less stress over configuring. Nginx is also a very reliable ingress controller.
Additionally, if we are more conecntrated on authentication and loadbalancing feature, then Traefik and HaProxy can be good choices.
