Though Kubernetes undoubtedly serves as a very reliable platform to our applications running inside the cluster becaus eof its capability to run the apllications in a group or cluster of machines, by restarting them ensuring its availability in case some pods fails. On top of that, it also has the built-in feature to connect different services of the application  together using ***build-in service discovery and load-balancing*** and it also supports stateful applications. But for the final goal of delivering the applications to the users, we need an ***L7 Loadbaalncer*** or ***Ingress Controller*** in other terms.

One of the most important necessities of ingress controllers is that it supports both <a href="">path-based</a> and <a href="">host-based loadbalancing </a> and SSL termination.Moreover, the L7 laodbalancing supports only HTTP and HTTPS rules for directing the trafiic and hence they listen on port numbers 80 and 443 respectively.

#### Path-based loadbalancing:



ðŸ’¡<b>NOTE:</b> ðŸ”¦
> Ingress has a strong precedence over NodePort or Loadbalancer in a way that it can integrate and amalgamate thee routing rules in a single resource to expose the multiple services available for the particular application.
> Ingress defines the routing rules for traffic which includes protocols like HTTPS/HTTPS, loadbalancing, path-based routing, SSL termination etc.  whereas Ingress controller is the component which holds the responsibility to implement all the ingress rules normally with a loadbalancer with an aim to handle the traffic .



## Nginx-based Ingress controller Vs HaProxy-based ingress controller Vs Traefik

Ingress in kubernetes can be implemented by using different ingress controllers like Nginx, Haproxy, Traefik, Istio, Envoy etc. Each ingress should specify a ***class*** which can be defined as a reference to an <code>IngressClass</code> resource which contains additional configurations including the name of the controller that should implement the classs. 
Here is a short example to the same(see under annotations of the ingress.yaml):<a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/blob/main/K3s/Demo/Certificate_with_k3s%2Bnginx/Ingress.yaml"><code>Click here</code></a> 

The section below includes a comparison table showing the focal point of differences between the mostly used opensource ingress controllers.
