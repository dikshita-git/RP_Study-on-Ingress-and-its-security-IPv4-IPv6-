## This file consists of the results to Research question : "Certificate analysis and comparison" with the following sub-questions:

<a href="">a) Compare the methods of generating the certificates with different type of ingress controllers</a>

<a href="">b) Determining the ways to distribute the generated certificate and providing them to the ingress controller</a>

<a href="">c) Can wildcard certficiates be beneficial during operations?</a>

<a href="">d) How does the complexity of using self-signed certificates compare to the automatic generation of certficiates in ingress controllers?</a>
  
<a href="">e) When can self-signed certificates be used without losing security?</a>
  
<a href="">f) How is the rotation of expiring certificates realized in ingress in kubernetes?</a>


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### a) Compare the methods of generating the certificates with different type of ingress controllers


Certificates in kubernetes is achieved with the help of an API to request certificates named as <code>certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1</code>





#### b) Determining the ways to distribute the generated certificate and providing them to the ingress controller

#### c) Can wildcard certficiates be beneficial during operations?

#### d) How does the complexity of using self-signed certificates compare to the automatic generation of certficiates in ingress controllers?

#### e) When can self-signed certificates be used without losing security?

#### f) How is the rotation of expiring certificates realized in ingress in kubernetes?
