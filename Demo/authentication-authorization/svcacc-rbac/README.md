## Authenticating kubernetes based on service token and Role-based access control

A special thanks to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bibinwilson/docker-kubectl">Bibin Wilson</a> for the reference to kubectl utility image used in this experiment.

Allowing limited access to kubernetes resources are a foundation ot the security of the cluster thus protecting it from malwares and phishing attacks. By default, kubernetes uses client certificates, bearer tokensor authentication proxy in order to authenticate the incoming API requests through the authentication plugins. Authentication in kubernetes validation of ***"who"*** and ***"what"*** is issuing the requests. Parallel to it, authorization means ***"verifies whether a certain action to list pods or services is allowed or permitted to a certain user(under a certain namespace may be)"***




By default kubernetes does not maintain any database to store the credentials of the users. This means that it expects it to be managed by an external source.
