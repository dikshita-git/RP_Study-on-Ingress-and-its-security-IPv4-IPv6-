# K3s using different ingrees controllers

K3s is such a powerful Kubernetes distributiion, which already has :

1. Klipper Load Balancer
2. Traefik Ingress Controller
3. etcd as storage directory
4. 4. Flannel as CNI

But never to forget thaat we have teh flexilibility to use external components instead of these built-in ones as they tend to have certain limitations when it comes to expanding K3s cluster with multiple nodes and providing the cluster a better performance and functionality.
In this folder, I have listed some catrgories where different types of loadbalancers, ingress controllers are used. 

Now, why that particular component was chosen, can be found in their respective folder's README files.
