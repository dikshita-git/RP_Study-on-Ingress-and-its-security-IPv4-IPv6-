## 1. Introduction

The word Ingress describes traffic originating from sources external to the network under investigation. In the kubernetes terminology, it is the name of a special resource type or more specifically a kind of an API object which follows some routing rules defined by the user to direct and forward traffic from the external world to the services running in the kubernetes cluster. Ingress has a strong precedence over NodePort or Loadbalancer in a way that it can integrate the routing rules in a single resource instead of exposing multiple services available for a particular application individually. It defines routing rules on layer 7 for the protocols HTTP and HTTPS. Other protocols are not supported. Additional features are loadbalancing, path-based routing, SSL termination, etc. . These features are implemented by dedicated ingress controllers. Since only HTTP and HTTPS rules are supported they usually listen on port numbers 80 and 443 respectively. 
There are several variations of ingress controllers available which can also be categorized as ***Cloud specific ingress controllers*** which is intended to integrate with the specific cloud loadbalancers and open ***source ingress controllers*** which is defined for more generic uses other than clouds. Some of the most popular and widely used implementations of ingress controllers are Nginx, Haproxy and Traefik. 

Additionally, it also becomes crucial to secure the ingress entering the Kubernetes cluster so that only the valid and legitimate traffic enters while the malicious and unauthorised traffic can be discarded or prevented. Besides the obvious advantage, this furthermore ensures that only the legitimate traffic is included in an application's monitoring. 

This project aims to compare the differences between the most widely used ingress controllers and also determines which could be considered a best choice of all. Moreover, it also compares the ways of generating the certificates in order to secure the ingress traffic and how can these certificates be distributed and provided to the type of ingress controller used. This is followed by understanding and evaluating if wildcard type of certifiacte can be beneficial and what could be the complexity measurement between a self-signed and default certificateconsidering the fact that security is not compromised.

In order to proceed further wwith the topic, the project pivots the belowmentioned points of motivaation:

* Determining the basic possibilities of protocols supported in ingress in kubernetes.

* Distinguish the kubernetes object type "ingress" from the other type of services. 

* Analysing points of diferences between different variations of ingress controllers in the market.

* Studying the necessity and detailed implementation of type of certificates to secure the ingress and analysing ways to auto-rotate them before expiration.



## 2. Approach and Goal

This project aims to secure the Ingress in a K3s cluster using different Ingress Cntrollers namely Traefik, HaProxy, Nginx and to study their differences in use-cases. Further, it also tests various certificates like self-signed, wildcard and default certificates and analyse automatic certificate rotation.

- to gain insights in the described functionalities, first some research questions shall be conducted. the goal is to answer them in the course of the project



## 3. Research Questions

- 3.1 Basic properties of underlying implementations
  
     - a) What are the principal point of differences between Traefik, HaProxy and Nginx?
        
     - b) Which scenarios fit best for the aforementioned alternatives and what are their operational differences?

 - 3.2 Certificate analysis and comparison
        
     - a) Compare the methods of generating the certificaates with different type of ingress controllers

     - b) Determining the ways to distribute the generated certificate and providing them to the ingress controller

     - c) Can wildcard certficiates be beneficial during operations?
  
     - d) How does the complexity of using self-signed certificates compare to the automatic generation of certficiates in ingress controllers?
    
     - e) When can self-signed certificates be used without losing security?</a>
       
     - f) How is the rotation of expiring certificates realized in ingress in kubernetes?
        
  
  - 3.3 Analysing how all the used certificates could be rotated automatically on startup before they expire and possible ways to recover from expired certificates.
  



## 4. Fundamentals

The initial step started with gathering the basic operational idea of ingress controller and default/wildcard certificates in kubernetes. Following which, some research was also conducted to analyse the procedures to generate the same and understanding their basic differences in applicability. A more detailed draft of the approaches made can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/tree/main/K3s/Chapters/Fundamentals"><code>Visit Fundamentals</code></a>.

 
 
## 5. Methodology

With the goal of exercising the roadmap produced, some methodologies to implement the same are carried out: <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/tree/main/K3s/Chapters/Methodoloy">Visit Methodology</a>



## 6. Results

After a thorough investigation of ingress controller and its implementations and usage of certificates to make the traffic secure, there are some observations and results marked. <a href="https://github.com/dikshita-git/RP_Ingress_security-IPv4_and_IPv6/tree/main/K3s/Chapters/Results"><code>Read Results</code></a>
