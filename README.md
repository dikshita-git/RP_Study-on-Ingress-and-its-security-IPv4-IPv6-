## Securing Ingress in K3s



### What is K3s?:
-This is a lightweight distribution of Kubernetes where we can easily create clusters and manage it using the tool K3d which basically means K3s with Docker.

- Applicable for: 

    a) IoT
    
    b) Edge Computing
    
    c) ARM etc. where the device components are smaller and holds minimal memory.
    
- It supports dual-stack from v1.21+

- This means both IPv4 and IPv6 works with K3S:
